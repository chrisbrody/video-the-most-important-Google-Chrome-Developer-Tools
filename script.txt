#CHROME_DEV 1.1 - Intro to Chrome Developer Tools
Hey Chris from Codify Academy here, in this video I want to review some Chrome developer tools, some you may already know about but hopefully I'll show you a few new ones

#CHROME_DEV 1.1 - List of Chrome Developer Tools to review
  1) review of most used tools - (
      select an element in the page,
      elements tab [click elements and see the css connected, test CSS, see what file is comes from, browser defaults, box model],
      sources tab  [refresh if nothing shows, select any file to see how it looks and you can replicate from there]
    )
  2) shortcut to open inspector - control / command shift i
  3) shortcut to select an element on the page - control / command shift c
  4) toggle device toolbar - use that next video series for media queries - control / command shift m
  5) elements - lesser used tools, but can be fun
      styles tab (filter, toggle element state, element classes, new style rule - use this to override existing code or to find what you want to change)
      computed tab (box model, showing all properties)
      don't worry about the other 3 right now, we'll return to these in a while
  6) console tab - displays missing files for links or images.
  7) network tab - (refresh if nothing shows, displays load time, what files where requested and returned and how long each file took, a look at things coming from the cache)
  8) download clear cache extension
